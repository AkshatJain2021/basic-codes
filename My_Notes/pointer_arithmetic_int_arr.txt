//POINTER ARITHMETIC
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{

int *i=&a;
i++;

cout<<i; //the pointer shifts to new integer ... i.e.,let the pointer pointing to memory loc 1024
         // after arithmetic the pointer gets incremented with 4 bytes since its an integer pointer
         //now the pointer points to 1028

cout<<*i ;  //the pointer prints the value pointed at 1028 memort location

//pointer arithmetic is useful for arrays as memory is continuous in arrays

 int a[10];
    
 cout<<a<<' '<<&a<<' '<<&a[0];     //the address printed will be same here i.e., address of pointer a

a[0]=5;
a[1]=10;

cout<<*a      //5 will be printed as output
cout<<*(a+1)  //10 will be printed as output

   // Here *(a+1) effictively evaluates as a[1]
   //a is 1024(say) therefore a+1 is 1028 as a is an integer pointer

//we can write arrays as 


cout<<a[8];
cout<<*(8+a);         //all the 3 will give the same output         
cout<<8[a];
 
// *(a+i)==a[i]==i[a]
