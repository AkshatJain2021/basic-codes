//CHARACTER POINTERS

//THEY WORK VERY DIFFERENTLY WHEN COMPARED TO INTEGER,FLOAT,DOUBLE POINTERS AS COUT AND CIN IS IMPLEMENTED DIFFERENTLY IN CASE OF CHARACTER ARRAYS
 
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    
char a='a';
    
char *b=&a;
    
cout<<b;        // Here instead of printing address of b, the compiler prints character 'a' followed by some garbage characters 
cout<<*b;       // character 'a' will be printed

//For arrays

char arr[10]="akshat";
     
cout<<arr<<' '<<&arr[0];     //Here akshat will be printed twice


//eg
char arr2[10]="jain"
char * p=&arr2[0];
cout<<p;                //Here jain will be printed
