//pointers
What are pointers?
Pointers are variables that stores the address of another variable/s
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
int i=10;     // 10 is stored in i
 &i           //gives the address of i
int * b= &i   // b stores the address of i

//as i was integer type hence we created a pointer variable of int type
//it reads as .. b is a pointer to an integer(int)

//eg

float f=10.2;
float*f2=&f;

char a='a';
char *a2=&a;

double p=10.9999;
double*p2=&p;

//if you want to access the value pointed by the pointer variable b
//we use dereference operator

cout<<*b;   //prints the value as 10 (as i=10 )
            // * is called the dereference operator

int o=i  //10 will be stored in variable o
int o=*b //" " " " 

//we can treat *p just like integer

 *p=19;    //changes the value of i to 19
(*p)++    //changes the value of i to 20

//safe practices of initialising a pointer 
int * p=0    // pointer points to NULL
int *p= &i   // pointer points to i
int *p      //unsafe practice

/* in case 3 *p can access a location and manipulate its value as well by using dereference operator
   this is very dangerous as we dont have the authority of that particular memory location */

// we should never try to initialise pointers in this way
